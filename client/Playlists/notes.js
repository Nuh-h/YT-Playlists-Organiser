//PROGRESS
//--Take a look at the /playlists route
//-- Make sure we are storing the correct details for each playlist fetched from YT
//-- Figure out a way to extract name (possible first few characters of first video || user inputted value! at upload)
//-- Figure out a way to fetch data at /id which should be very easy using /playlists/:ID and then in componentMounted fetch from iD obtained through prop. Prop was inserted at App.js when choosing component for route.
//--------------//
// I will add methods to mongoose that will fetch for example only titles rather than whole document.
