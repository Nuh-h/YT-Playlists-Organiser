# YT-Playlists-Organiser

As the name suggests, the intention for this project is to be able to fetch, load, organise and manage playlists (of videos specifically from YouTube at the moment). That is to say, enable Creation, Reading, Updating and Deletion of playlists and their videos.

## Current Progress
Early stages are complete. You can upload an existing playlist, and view it. Lists of all playlists are available.

Next stage: organise styling, start adding core features such as enabling re-arrangement or removal of videos.
